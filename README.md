# Calendar Planner **WIP**

**Author**: Brandon Jarvis, 2024

This is a HTML/CSS/JavaScript web project that will allow you to view a calendar and enter tasks for specific days. It is currently a work in progress and not all features are implemented. 

## Accessing the Webpage

This planner is not yet hosted on a webpage, so the only way to use it currently is on your local machine. 

Create a local copy of this repository on your machine and open `index.html` in order to access the page. 

## Usage

Work In Progress.
